                    <h4>The purpose of a recipe</h4>
                    <p>Among the many tools which a Chef has at his disposal a standard<br>
                    recipe template is among the most important. For the Professional<br>
                    Chef, the important and purpose of a recipe is both practical and<br>
                    theoretical. It is meant to include the technical aspects of a dish<br>
                    while also teaching the artistic combination of flavor and texture. A<br>
                    recipe communicates the ingredients and procedures the chef uses<br>
                    to make his creations. It is this tool which allows the chef to train and<br>
                    replicate his skill to his staff.</p>
                    <h4>The Recipe: A Guide for Success</h4>
                    <p>A Chef who keeps all of his recipes in his head must do all the<br>
                    cooking himself in order to make the recipes correctly. He will not be<br>
                    able to get consistency from other employees unless he puts it into recipe form to give to his staff. If the Chef scribbles all<br>
                    of his recipes on scraps of paper, agaion he will have difficulty maintaining a positive guest experience from his food. Of<br>
                    course, a recipe is not perfect, and the kitchen crew still needs to learn how to make final adjustments on seasoning and<br>
                    consistency in order to match the Chef's palate. In this sense a recipe is a guideline, a way for the Chef to point his crew in<br>
                    the proper direction. But in the end, cooks need to know the palate and expectations of the Chef in order to reproduce<br>
                    the recipe to his standards.</p>
                    <h4>Recipe Template as an Artistic Tool</h4>
                    <p>Ultimately a recipe is a template by which a chef educates his staff to meet his criteria for flavor and technique on any<br>
                    given dish. The goal is that the staff would be able to replicate the taste, texture, and presentation without the chef's help.<br>
                    In practice this means that the cook's palate will be able to recognize if an ingredient's flavor profile has changed and then<br>
                    make the correct adjustments on the recipe in order to still meet the chef's expectation regarding flavor profile and<br>
                    texture.</p>

                            <h3>Pecan Pie Cobbler</h3>
                            <p>I couldn't find a recipe, so I took it upon myself and devised this amazing dessert<br>
                            that combines the ease of a cobbler and the rich taste of pecan pie. It tastes even<br>
                            better with ice cream or whipped topping. -- Willia Kelley, Edmond, Oklahoma</p>
